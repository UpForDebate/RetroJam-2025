Every building hides a secret. Some hide mold. Some hide debt.\
This one hides… an illegal armory.
Because apparently, the jam believed in strong conflict resolution.
- 9mm Handgun
	Classic, reliable, morally ambiguous.
	Edgar loads the handgun.
	edgar: You wanted closure, Moisés? Let’s close this.
	Gunfire echoes through the halls.
	Moisés staggers, falls.
	And just like that, the circle of violence was complete.\
	HR would call it “termination with cause.”
	Edgar survives. The building, less so.
	[ENDING\: “Conflict Resolved”]
- Sawed-Off Shotgun
	Edgar grabs the shotgun, trembling.
	moises: You never could handle responsibility.
	Edgar fires — the recoil launches him backwards into a PC setup
	The gun worked perfectly. Edgar didn’t
	[BAD ENDING\: “Occupational Hazard”]
- Assault Rifle
	Two hundred hours of Counter-Strike can't have been for nothing.
	Moisés slowly aproaches...
	moises: Already an AK on the second round? That's poor money management.
	edgar: Eat lead Moisés!
	Edgar sprays the rifle, realising the trigger is heavier than the mouse click.
	The wall is completly pierced. Moisés not so much...
	[BAD ENDING\: “Back to Silver”]
- Grenade
	Edgar grabs the grenade. Pulls the pin.
	edgar: See you in hell, buddy.
	Explosion.
	In the end, Edgar found peace — and most of the fourth floor found new ventilation.
