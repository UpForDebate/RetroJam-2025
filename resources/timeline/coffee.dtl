	Edgar hoists the office coffee machine — a heavy, sputtering relic of the 90s. He hurls steaming espresso at the undead menace!
	moises: You burned me once already, Edgar…
	Moisés screams, blinded by boiling coffee — but the caffeine seems to energize him instead.\
	He starts running. Fast.
	Edgar escapes… for now. But now Moisés can sprint like a man possessed.
	Congratulations. You’ve invented a caffeinated zombie.
	[ENDING\: "Nespresso - What else?"]
- No
	edgar: I'll drink it later.
