In the grand theater of life, everyone eventually plays two roles\: the victim... and the idiot responsible.
Our story begins with Edgar — sound engineer by day, accidental murderer by... poor impulse control.
It all started last year. Edgar and his coworker Moisés had a simple disagreement. Something small. Petty.
Like who should occupy a small space\: Moisés or a door?
A shove. A slip. The wrong place at the wrong time.

And just like that — Moisés was gone.
Edgar swore it was an accident. And for a while, he believed that.
Until today.

You see… Moisés is back. Not as a man…
But as something far worse.

A game developer with unfinished projects.
And Edgar?

He ran. And he’s trapped in the game jam building, armed only with his wits — and whatever questionable objects he can find in the break room.
Can he survive the night?
Or will justice… crunch to get the job done?
