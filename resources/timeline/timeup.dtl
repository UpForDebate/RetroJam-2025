Ah. Time.
The one resource Edgar could never manage — not at work, not in life, and definitely not when chased by a reanimated corpse with a grudge.
When the final seconds fade, the building goes quiet.
The lights flicker once… twice… then die.
The emergency generator hums to life, bathing everything in an unholy fluorescent glow.
moises: Deadline’s up, Edgar.
edgar: M-Moisés, wait! I just need—
moises: You always said that.
In the game dev world, missing a deadline is a grave offense.\
In this case… literally.
And so ends Edgar’s brief career in survival — terminated for poor time management.
